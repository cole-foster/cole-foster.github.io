                    I am a researcher in Similarity Search, focused on designing algorithms for accurate and efficient 
                    retrieval on large, high-dimensional datasets. My particular research topics:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Search on massive-scale datasets </li>
                        <li> Parallelization strategies for multi-core CPUs and GPUs </li>
                        <li> Design and construction of proximity graphs at scale </li>
                        <li> Applications of similarity search and of databases organized by proximity graphs</li>
                    </ul>
                    I am currently a PhD Candidate at Brown University studying under Professor Kimia in 
                    the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE). I received my Masters of Science at Brown 
                    in 2024 and my undergraduate degree at Roger Williams University in 2020.
