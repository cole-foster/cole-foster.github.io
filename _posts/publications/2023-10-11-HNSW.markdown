### Abstract
The Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) Graph is a graph-based approximate similarity search algorithm that achieves fast and accurate search through a hierarchical structure providing long-range and short-range links. The HNSW remains as a state-of-the-art method, as shown by this submission to the SISAP 2023 Indexing Challenge. This submission introduces a modification to the implementation of HNSW that avoids the cost of a batched construction and drastically reduces disk-space of the saved index when working with large datasets. Through the lens of this competition, this work provides a careful analysis of several important factors for high-performance applications, including the removal of unnecessary functionality, the use of SIMD vectorization for distance computations, and optimal utilization of cache through spatial locality and cache prefetching.
